# homebrew-gitsweeper

This is a [Homebrew tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) repository for [gitsweeper](https://github.com/petems/gitsweeper), a CLI tool for cleaning up merged Git branches.

## What is gitsweeper?

[gitsweeper](https://github.com/petems/gitsweeper) is a command-line tool written in Go that helps you clean up Git repositories by identifying and removing branches that have been merged into the main branch. It's a modern, optimized replacement for the original Python-based git-sweep tool.

### Key Features
- **Preview mode**: See which branches are ready for cleanup without deleting them
- **Cleanup mode**: Remove merged branches safely
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Optimized**: Ultra-fast performance with a small binary size (~7.8MB)

## Installation

### Using this Homebrew tap

```bash
# Install directly from this tap
brew install petems/homebrew-gitsweeper/gitsweeper

# Or add the tap first, then install
brew tap petems/homebrew-gitsweeper
brew install gitsweeper
```

### Alternative installation methods

See the [main gitsweeper repository](https://github.com/petems/gitsweeper#installation) for other installation options including:
- Quick install script
- Pre-built binaries
- Building from source

## Usage

```bash
# Preview branches that can be cleaned up
gitsweeper preview

# Clean up merged branches
gitsweeper cleanup
```

## How this repository works

This repository contains the Homebrew cask formula that gets automatically updated during the gitsweeper release process. Here's how it works:

1. **Automated releases**: When a new version of gitsweeper is released, the [release workflow](https://github.com/petems/gitsweeper/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) in the main repository automatically:
   - Builds the application using GoReleaser
   - Generates the Homebrew cask formula
   - Pushes the updated formula to this repository

2. **Formula generation**: The cask file in `Casks/gitsweeper.rb` is auto-generated by GoReleaser and includes:
   - Platform-specific download URLs for macOS (Intel/ARM) and Linux (Intel/ARM)
   - SHA256 checksums for security verification
   - Proper metadata and descriptions

3. **No manual maintenance**: This repository is fully automated - the formula is kept up-to-date automatically with each gitsweeper release.
